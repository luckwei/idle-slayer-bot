## Idle Slayer bot

The desktop version of the game is available on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1353300/Idle_Slayer/

### Motivation

I personally enjoyed the game a lot, first when it was on mobile (even paid to remove ads). However as time went by, to explore the game further and make any progress at all, it had to be played actively for hours with no mechanical element of gameplay, just mindlessly tapping the same buttons and hotkeys in a grinding fashion. Hence instead of stopping the game entirely, I saw it as a coding challenge to try to bring automation to the mid to late-game stages.

### Limitations

#### Early-game automation is absent\*
Too complex, would not have helped much and would be more fun to just play manually.

#### Coordinates are configured only according to my own screen
Currently made for my personal set ups
- Dual monitor mode: 1280x720 | 1920x1080
- Single monitor mode: 1920x1080
*Will slowly transition to softcoding coordinates to be usable on all displays and monitors*

#### Complicated gameplay is avoided
Features to be developed
- Completing special stages (skipping them is a current feature)

#### Unable to automate in the background
This is one of the main features I would like to crack, however either Steam or Idle Slayer has added protection against SendKeys. Further research is needed to develop a solution.

#### UI not developed yet
Hotkeys are currently available but a user friendly UI is not developed yet.
